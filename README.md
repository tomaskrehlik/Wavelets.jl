# Wavelets
This package should eventually end up replicating the good parts of various implementations of wavelet methods in R and MATLAB that I have used.

## Done so far ##

- DWT works
- MODWT works
- MRA works
- Test suite against R wavelets package.

## To be done ##

- Plotting techniques
- Better testing techniques
- Packet wavelet transform
- Coherences, phase differences estimates

## Inspired by: ##
So far, the code is insipired by [wavelets package from R](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavelets/index.html)
